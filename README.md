![App Demo](link_to_demo_gif_or_screenshot.gif)

## Introduction

The Social Distancing App is an application that leverages computer vision and deep learning models to monitor and detect violations of social distancing guidelines among people in images or video streams. This README provides an overview of the app, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Features

- Real-time detection of people in images or video streams.
- Calculation of the Euclidean distances between people to check for violations.
- Alerting and visualization of violations in the output.
- Customizable threshold for defining unsafe distances.
- Support for different object detection models (e.g., MobileNet-SSD, YOLO).

## Prerequisites

Before using the app, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-distancing-app.git
